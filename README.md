# Linear-Regression-for-predicting-House-Prices.

I have used Linear regression for making this project.It involves the below steps:
  1) Dataset collection and cleaning
  2) Dataset pre-processing
  3) Outlier detection and removal
  4) Applying LR.
  5) Pipelining

I have also deployed my ML model onto a live website for real-time house price prediction.
The tech Stacks I've used are Python, Scikit-learn, Flask, HTML,CSS,Javascript and Heroku.
